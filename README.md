# vowelSubstring
Given a string of lowercase letters in the range ascii['a'-'z'], determine the number of substrings that can be created where every letter is a vowel and every vowel is present at least once. The vowels are ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']. A substring is a contiguous group of characters in the string.
